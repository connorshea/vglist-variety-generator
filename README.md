# vglist Variety Generator

Based on an image that floated around social media, where people would share an image with a list of 100 game series' and fill out which game series' they've played. For the hell of it, I've create (well, Work In Progress, it doesn't quite do this yet) a little website that used the [vglist](https://vglist.co) API to fill it out for you.

Built with Vue 3, TypeScript, and Vite.

To run locally, you'll want to have Node 16 and Yarn v1 installed.

Then:
- Clone the repo
- Run `yarn install`
- Run `yarn run vite`

And then the site will be available at localhost:3000.
